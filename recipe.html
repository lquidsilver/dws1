        <i>"All you really need for guacamole is ripe avocados and salt. After that, the next most important ingredient is lime juice (or lemon if you don't have lime). Then come the cilantro, chiles, onion, and tomato."

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
    <li>1/2 red onion, minced (about 1/2 cup)</li>
    <li>1-2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of fresh lime or lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
    <li>A dash of freshly grated black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Cut avocados in half. Remove seed. Scoop out avacado from the peel, put in a mixing bowl. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.) Add the chopped onion, cilantro, lime or lemon, salt and pepper and mash some more. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness. Be careful handling the peppers; wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.(Chilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so don't chop the tomatoes or add to the guacamole until ready to serve. Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.)

            Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole to prevent oxidation from the air reaching it. Refrigerate until ready.

            Just before serving, chop the tomato, add to the guacamole and mix.
